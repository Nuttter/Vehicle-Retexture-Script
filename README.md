# Vehicle-Retexture-Script
A simple vehicle retexture example for one of Night Wolfs helicopters, simply open config.cpp in either notepad or notepad++ to make changes.

Open data/Helipolice_example.paa in DayZ Tools>Texview save image as .png edit your image in your favourite image editor and save.
Open the edited texture in Texview again and save as .paa

If done correctly you should be able to pack the script using DayZ Tools>Addon Builder

I do not take credit for this script in any way shape or form, this script was originally created by Night Wolf and I have learnt how to utilise this for almost any vehicle in game. With a little time and understanding almost anyone can use this for any helicopter *NOTE Helipolice is the easiest to retexture as it only requires 1 image file*
